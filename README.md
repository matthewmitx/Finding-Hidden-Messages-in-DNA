# Finding-Hidden-Messages-in-DNA

This repository provides a collection algorithms that are useful for finding patterns in various DNA datasets. The two general use cases are:
  1. To locate probable kmers on a single strand of DNA taking in factors such as mismatches and unknown kmer length
  2. To discover frequently occuring motifs within an unaligned set of DNA strands taking in factors such as mismatches and unknown motif length
  
All functions are prefaced with objective-defining descriptions as well as the intented input and output.
All code written by Matthew Mitchell.
